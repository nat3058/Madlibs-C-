# Madlibs in C++
A program that can be executed in the terminal. Maybe it will make you laugh.
***BEWARE: system() is used in this program without any input sanitization, and thus, can be a security hazard. Please be wise when using this program and perhaps remove its executable permissions after use. Thank you.***
